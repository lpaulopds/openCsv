I setup a blank instance for several people and tasked them with achieving specific goals without having them look at any documentation beforehand.

A more streamlined and expansive use of the custom fields. For example, let's say we have a contact who now works at company A. We want to add a custom field labeled ""Previous company"" in which to put company B so we can remember our contact used to work there and is still a potential source of leads from company B. Next, we simply clone the field provided in every Mautic install labeled ""Primary company"" and voila... except that's not what happens. The cloned field doesn't have the same access to the ""Company"" database for it to select from because it's not actually a full clone. Unfortunately, our contact has worked at a few previous places we would like to keep track of. At this point, assuming our user isn't particularly technical, the user is left to create a wonky workaround like creating another custom field with the ""Select - Multiple"" data type and duplicating the entire company list as values (because if we're doing it for one contact we likely want to do it for more). Or, the user can try to find a plugin that might solve the issue or perhaps seek help from someone with more technical skills. Either way it's a lot more effort than just being able to select the ""Company"" data. Another similar example is if we want to remember our contact also knows another contact in our database. Unfortunately, our contact knows a lot of other people in our database and it would be much simpler to be able to use our ""Contacts"" data in a similar fashion to the Mautic core ""Primary company"" selection then to create another custom field and add the entire ""Contacts"" data in it.

The ability to more easily move all the fields around for a contact/company and place them in any order the user desires. Currently the core fields are divided into these ""untouchable sections"" (from a non-technical user's perspective) but as increased customization appears it also increases Mautic's broader appeal and speeds increased adoption.","Better support, documentation, and training, More marketing and promotion, Staying on top of pull requests.

",Well-positioned,"Mautic is well-positioned because when I had looked at it a few years ago it was not ready for primetime. At the time, I marked it as a project to check back in on later and I'm happy I did. In my opinion, Mautic now has enough features and stability to provide what a large percentage of its audience needs. The continued improvements will only make it better but it's poised well in the marketplace for individuals and small-med businesses. Mautic fits in perfectly to the aforementioned niche because costs are always a major concern for those segments and you can't beat Mautic's pricing. Mautic also has the advantage over competitors because it's FOSS and if the businesses using Mautic are made aware if they want a particular feature implemented or bug fixed they don't have to wait. If they're willing to spend a few dollars themselves they can have whatever they want. Plus, considering they didn't spend anything on the software maybe they'll view that new feature designed exactly how they want as an expense they're willing to spend."
